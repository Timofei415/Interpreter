# Interpreter

The repository contains 2 python files:
1) LetterRecognition.py - the program that trains neural network and saves the parameters into the separate file (parameters.py)
2) Interpreter.py - the Interpreter program that uses the parameters to interpret the handwritten text

PNG files:
1) Alphabet(1-7).png -  the files of handwritten text used to create the training set letterset.png
2) testing_text(1-2).png - the handwtitten text you can use to test the program

In order to use the program open Interpreter.py, then choose the file you want to test (e.g. testing_text1.png). After the picture is opened, highlight the text (several words, sentences, or the whole text) you want to interpret and click ok. The text will appear in the text window on the left.
